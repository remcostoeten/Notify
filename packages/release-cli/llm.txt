# @remcostoeten/release-cli

AI-powered release automation CLI with LLM-generated changelogs.

## Purpose

This CLI tool automates the complete software release workflow:
1. Determines version bump (semver)
2. Fetches git commits since last tag
3. Uses AI (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) to generate structured changelog
4. Updates package.json version
5. Updates CHANGELOG.md
6. Builds the package
7. Creates git commit and tag
8. Pushes to remote
9. Publishes to npm

## Architecture

The CLI is structured as a command-based tool using Commander.js with the following components:

### Core Commands
- `release run` - Full release pipeline
- `release changelog` - Generate changelog only
- `release status` - Show current release status
- `release init` - Interactive setup wizard
